    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.</li><br>
        <li>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over 
            <br>medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (145 to 150 
            <br>degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)). </li><br>
        <li>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all 
            <br>chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally 
            <br>to further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture 
            <br>shouldn't go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture
            <br> may get too firm to fold in.</li><br>
        <li>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate 
            <br>and the final texture will be grainy.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until 
            <br>almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in 
            <br>the mixture as possible.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.</li><br>
        <li>Enjoy your simple yet delicous mousse</li><br>

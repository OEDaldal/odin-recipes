        <li>2 cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon salt & ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown sausage and ground beef with onion and garlic in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over 
            <br>medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain
            <br>and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, Italian-style crushed tomatoes,
            <br>tomato paste, basil, 2 tablespoons parsley, brown sugar, salt, Italian seasoning, black 
            <br>pepper, fennel seeds, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into meat mixture. Bring to a boil, 
            <br>reduce heat to low, and simmer sauce for at least 1 hour (up to 6 for best flavor). 
            <br>Stir occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into a deep bowl and cover with very hot tap water; 
            <br>let soak for 30 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Beat egg in a bowl and stir ricotta cheese, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
            <br>and nutmeg into egg until thoroughly combined.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cover bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 cup sauce. Layer 4 soaked lasagna noodles, 
            <br>1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup 
            <br>Parmesan cheese in the dish. Repeat layers twice more, ending with mozzarella and 
            <br>Parmesan cheeses. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</li><br>
        <li>Bake until lasagna noodles are tender and casserole is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove 
            <br>foil and bake until cheese topping is lightly browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Let 
            <br>stand 15 minutes before serving.</li><br>
        <li>Bon appetit!</li>
